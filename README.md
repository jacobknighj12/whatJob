## WhatJob - Career Advice from Career Professionals!

- Target audience
  The app will cater to students that are in highschool, while also aiming to garner some professionals that would like to
  share their experiences with said students both being the demographic while the main consumer of the content would be the younger demographic
  or people that are wanting to change up their career and want to explore more positions due to even in adulthood you still don't have
  much available useful collections of information of what jobs consist of

- Purpose
  The purpose of the website is to provide career guidance for those in mainly primary and high school education. With the current state of education
  schools have failed to provide adequate ways to introduce students to the real world careers with much of media glorifying specific positions, while
  many roles that many people may love are unknown to most due to not having anywhere to fully explore the world of jobs with proper explanations of all
  complexities of each job.
  The content is to be written by way of separate posts by professionals in each field. These post will be sorted through categories to allow ease of access and useability to encourage use and exploration of different avenues.

- Functionality / features
  To post, a user must register. The registration will be done by way of token Authorization will be along with authentication.

  These posts will identify the obligations in the job as well as this list of sections:

        Intro
        Day to day
        Career path
        Expected salary
        Difficulty level
        Reliability
        Work/life Balance
        Deep dive click through
        Rating

  These posts will be organized by way of categories. The categories will be drawn from other job search websites.
  The posts can be up-voted and down-voted by logged in users, ordering by way of most up-voted post to show those seeking information about a particular occupation the most relevant posts.
  There will also be a report feature to send a message to the website administrator for posts which will enable reporting by logged in users.

### R4 User Stories

The user stories for this project were showing our way of implementing the Agile
Methodology using trello, dates, difficulties, assigning each card, with each card
having a full user story for it and having requirements for each card to be moved between 
sections and having daily standup's at 2PM after classes as well as general discussion on any
details that needed ironing out.

### R6 Screenshots of your Trello board throughout the duration of the project

    Throughout the planning phase we were constantly aware that our scope must be limited
    and were adding cards from a joint google document that we had drafts of that were, added in or
    excluded for extra content if we have time for it.
    As the method was gradually introduced it was further and further implemented in each of the cards 
    with more details being added like the fibonacci difficulties and dates.
